        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of the project was to create a private, multiplayer server
          for Minecraft that runs on a Linux Virtual Machine, specifically using
          Google Cloud Platform. The server is set up through Java. We would be
          able to control the privacy, security, and the plugins/mods that are
          added to the server. There are specific groups for the general users
          and admins that let them read/write/execute certain files and folders.
          Automatic processes such as logging general processes, memory
          consumption, and automatic backups of the server are implemented in
          the server as well. We also added general mods and plugins to our
          server that improve the user experience. We have our own fun plugins
          that we created and implemented to the server as well.

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Running a Minecraft server allows a person playing Minecraft to join
          the private, multiplayer server to play with others. This is a way to
          add your own rules and features to a Minecraft world where you can
          choose to play with only a handful of specific players. A user who has
          the server information will be able to connect to the Minecraft world
          and interact with other players. The server also has mods and plugins
          that can enhance the experience of playing Minecraft. Lastly, admins
          of the server can control who is able to access the server and ban
          users in order to maintain a desired playerbase
