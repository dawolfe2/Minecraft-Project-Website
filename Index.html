        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to create a Minecraft server that runs on
          a Linux VM. The VM will run the Minecraft server so that a user
          playing Minecraft can enter the server. The server will have some
          automation and system logging as well as additional features.

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This service will allow a user to join the server while playing
          Minecraft as long as they know the name of the server and the
          password. Any extra features implemented in the server will be
          available to a person playing in the Minecraft world.
